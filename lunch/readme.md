## Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-light olive oil, or as needed
2 slices Italian bread
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 slices Cheddar cheese 
3 slices deli ham, or more to taste
1 slice firm-ripe tomato 
1 thin slice onion
cooking spray

## Equipment needed:
Panini press

## Steps for preparation:
Step 1: Drizzle olive oil on 1 side of each bread slice. Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise on the other side of each slice. Pile Cheddar cheese, ham, tomato, and onion on top. Top with other bread slice, mayonnaise side down.

Step 2: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat; spray lightly with cooking spray. Place sandwich on grill; weigh it down with a heavy pan. Cook until cheese is melted and grill marks appear, 3 to 5 minutes per side.


### Notes:
This basic recipe is easily changed up with prosciutto, salami, or even turkey. This is also great as a veggie sandwich.

You can substitute French bread for Italian bread, if preferred.

You can substitute extra-virgin olive oil for the extra-light olive oil, if preferred.

You can use spreadable cheese in place of mayonnaise, if preferred.

You can use this recipe to make multiple sandwiches; assemble them ahead of time, grill, and place in a warm oven until serving.

I recommend a George Forman(R) grill because it eliminates the need for flipping. If you don't have a grill pan, use a regular cast iron or nonstick skillet.
